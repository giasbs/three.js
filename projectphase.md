PHASE 1 – Overall concept, visual style, and scene structure
You are an expert frontend and three.js developer. Create a web-only interactive playground website that runs in a modern desktop browser, using vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript and three.js only (no React, no frameworks, no external animation libraries). The main focus of the site is a colorful, fun 3D playground scene that feels like a small park: include soft grass, trees, flowers, a sandbox, a swing set, a slide, benches, and a small path winding through the garden. The entire experience should feel whimsical, bright, and childlike, with saturated but tasteful colors, soft shadows, and rounded shapes. The homepage should be a full-window 3D canvas using three.js, with a minimal UI overlay (logo/title and a few buttons) positioned using HTML/CSS. The layout must be designed for web browser usage on desktop and laptop; make it responsive for different screen sizes, but you do not need to design for mobile apps or native platforms. Use a clean file structure (for example: index.html, styles.css, main.js, playgroundScene.js) and set up the scene with a perspective camera, orbit controls, basic ambient and directional lighting, and a nice sky gradient or skybox that matches a sunny day in the park. The playground should be composed of simple low-poly style geometry so it feels approachable and performant, but still visually rich.

PHASE 2 – Interactivity, “touchable” elements, and user experience
Now focus on making the environment feel “touchable” and interactive using three.js only. Implement mouse-based interactions such as hover and click on key objects in the playground. For example, when the user hovers over the swing, the swing slightly moves and highlights; clicking it makes the swing gently animate back and forth in a loop. The slide can glow softly on hover, and when clicked, trigger a playful particle effect near the base, like tiny sparkles or confetti. Trees can rustle or sway slightly when hovered, flowers can subtly grow or tilt towards the cursor, and lamps or lanterns can turn on with a warm glow when clicked (even in daytime, just as a magical effect). Use raycasting in three.js to detect which objects are being hovered or clicked, and change material colors, emissive values, or animations to show feedback. Integrate smooth camera transitions so that clicking on UI buttons (like “Garden”, “Play Area”, “Relax Zone”) animates the camera to pre-defined viewpoints that showcase different parts of the playground. All animations should be handled either with three.js built-in capabilities or small custom animation loops in JavaScript, without external libraries. Ensure the experience remains performant: reuse materials when possible, keep polycounts reasonable, and limit heavy effects while still maintaining a sense of richness and movement.

PHASE 3 – Content, storytelling, polish, and accessibility
In this phase, refine the site into a delightful, polished web experience. Design an HTML overlay that contains a friendly title (for example: “WonderPlay Garden”), a short introductory paragraph describing the playground, and a small navigation bar or floating menu that lets users jump to different sections of the park via camera movements. Add a subtle “info panel” system: when the user clicks on certain objects (such as the sandbox, slide, garden, or benches), an information card smoothly fades in from the side or bottom of the screen using CSS transitions. Each card should contain a short, warm description of that object’s purpose or story, plus a small icon or illustration styled with pure CSS. Make sure the color palette of the UI matches the 3D scene: pastel backgrounds, rounded corners, playful typography, and clear contrast for readability. Add basic accessibility touches: allow keyboard navigation for UI buttons, provide descriptive aria-label attributes where appropriate, and ensure text is large enough with sufficient contrast. Include instructions somewhere in the UI (“Hover over objects and click to interact”, “Use your mouse to look around the playground”) so users understand how to explore. Finally, add tasteful ambient sound support with a toggle button (for example, light birds chirping, children laughing in the distance, wind rustling leaves), implemented in vanilla JavaScript, with the audio off by default and turned on by user action to respect browser policies. The final output should be a fully working web-only three.js playground site that feels colorful, touchable, interactive, and inviting, with well-commented code explaining how the scene, interactions, and UI are structured.
